# Dictionary: It is an ORDERED(only after Python3.7 release) collection of data 
#             values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other 
#             data types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary 
#             holds KEY:VALUE pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to 
#             make it more optimized.
#             Dictionary is MUTABLE and ITERABLE.
#             *Note: Keys in a dictionary donâ€™t allow Polymorphism.

'''
**note 1: Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within 
          curly {} braces, separated by 'comma'. Dictionary holds pairs of values, 
          one being the KEY and the other corresponding pair element being its 
          VALUE. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be 
          duplicated, whereas keys can't be repeated and can't be duplicated.
