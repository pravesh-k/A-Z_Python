'''
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language which means that it supports different 
approaches of programming. And OOPs is one of them.
'''


# OOPs: Object Oriented Programming. This pradigm of programming is based on "Objects".
#       OOPs aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, 
#       polymorphism, etc in programming.

# Object: In real world object is anything which is tangible and relatively stable. 
#         Similarly in programming, objects are the interpretation of real world    
#         objects and they posses some attributes and behaviour. Where, we refer 
#         attributes as the data part of the object and behaviour as the methods 
#         of the object.

# Class: Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. A class can 
#        also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. 
#        Class doesn't consume any space.
