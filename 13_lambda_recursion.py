# Lambda Functions: Also known as Anonymous functions in python, are such 
#                   functions which do not have a name. The lambda can take any 
#                   number of arguments, but can only have one expression. While 
#                   normal functions are defined using the 'def' keyword in 
#                   Python, anonymous functions are defined using the 'lambda' 
#                   keyword.
