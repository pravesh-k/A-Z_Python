# While Loop: It is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a
#             given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, 
#             the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed. 
#             While loop falls under the category of indefinite iteration. 

#             Indefinite iteration means that the number of times the loop is   
#             executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance.

# 1. While loop

# Example 1: printing Hello World three times
count = 0
while count < 3:        # iterate this block till value of count is less than 3
    count = count + 1       # increment the value of count by 1
    print(f'Hello World {count}')
print()     #this line is out of while block


# 2. Single statement while block

# Example 1: multi-statement inside single statement while loop
count = 3
while count < 6: count = count + 1; print(f'Hello Python {count}')
print()

# Example 2: nested compound statements inside single statement while loop
steps = 0
while steps < 6: print(f'Bonjour! {steps}') if steps % 2 == 0 else print(f'Adios {steps}'); steps += 1
'''note that short-hand if-else statement is used'''
